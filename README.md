# Eddy
Eddy is a text editor.  I created it to try out an idea I had for reducing mouse usage during text editing.  Eddy replaces traditional menus, shortcuts, and keybindings with a type of menu inspired by pie menus but adapted to the keyboard.  Hold down one of the Ctrl keys, and a representation of the opposite half of the keyboard shows up, with the keys labeled with commands.  Press one of the keys to execute the command.  It’s like shortcuts, but discoverable.  It’s like menus, but doesn’t take your fingers off the home row.  It’s like Vim’s command mode, but quasi-modal.  Of course, in the future, some of the keys will open up new menus to accommodate more commands.

## Status
It’s still bare-bones, but you can:
 * Open files from the command line
 * Move the cursor using RCtrl+ESDF
 * Open and close multiple windows
 * Save files
 * Cut, copy, and paste; although there’s no good way to select text with the keyboard
